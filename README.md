# GVPT628_FinalProject

This is the GitHub repository for my GVPT628 Final Project titled "Did China Drive Its Own Image Problem? Analyzing Events and Filipino Public Opinion".

My final report can be found in the documentation folder. I reccommend that you view it in its html format, as that is what I primarily rendered it in. Link to that is here:

**https://zeinolf.github.io/GVPT628_FinalProject/documentation/Final_Report.html**

Code to replicate my data cleaning, API pulling, and analyses can be found in the code folder.

All of the data that I used for the final report document (and that I pulled using the code I mentioned above) can be found in the data folder.
